There once was a boy named Harry Potter. His parents passed away when he was very young, so he lived with his aunt and uncle.
He did not like his aunt and uncle very much, as they did not treat him very well. One day, a large and strong man named Hagrid
came to his house.

Hagrid surprised Harry by telling him he was a wizard just like his parents. Harry was thrilled by this news because he would do 
anything to escape his aunt and uncle. Harry had to go shopping to get all of his school supplies like his cape, wand, textbooks,
and broomstick. Then the day came when he boarded the train and set off to Hogwarts.
